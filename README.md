Part 4 of my mass media tracking and voting. This is for animes as they appear on ranime's automated bot AutoLPon.

This has two programs. 
One generates a notification when my favorite animes appear on that bot. For now it's general sounds get triggered on Windows.
Second is a GreaseMonkey script which automates the reddit Survey process used by YouPoll based on me upvoting an anime. 
YouPoll is no longer in use by r/anime and thus this is abandoned. The idea can be carried over to any service that utilises Reddit's app authorisation process.
